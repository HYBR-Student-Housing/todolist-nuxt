# Broken TodoList | Nuxt.js

Forked from a project by [Hedi Jabri](https://github.com/HediJabri)

We picked this project because it uses a similar stack to the one we do. You should get confortable with the codebase and understand how it works. 

This project is currently broken. There is no need to fix any code, just figure out what's broken and why.

During the interview we'll provide a working version of this project and we will be asking some basic questions about the project and javascript in general.

## Instructions

1. Clone the project
2. Install packages
3. Start the dev server
4. Navigate to the app in the browser

You'll need git and nodejs.

Send us an email if you're stuck and we'll help. Reaching out for help is a good thing and there are no stupid questions. 

1. Tell us why you're blocked. Provide as much context as possible.
2. List the things you've tried and the outcome. Why didn't they work?

We'll get back to you as soon as possible.

## Technologies

This app is made with Vue.js & Nuxt.js, built with the create-nuxt-app cli (Vuetify, Axios, Vuex modules)
I also used [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a fake REST API.

## Features

This project is a simple Todo List App with basic CRUD actions. Here is the full features list:

Required
- Create a new Todo (press enter on input or click on the + icon)
- Mark a todo as done a (click on the check icon)
- Edit a todo (Double-click on the todo text => press enter to validate / esc to cancel)
- Delete a todo (click on the cross icon)

Bonus
- Circular loaders for each todo item (to cover server response time)
- Filtering todos by status (done / todo)
